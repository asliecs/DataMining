# Data Mining Course Tasks

This repository contains the tasks and exercises I completed during my **Data Mining** course, where I learned key concepts and methods in **descriptive** and **predictive data mining**. The course focused on both **unsupervised** and **supervised learning** techniques, with an emphasis on practical applications using real-world, large-scale datasets.

Throughout the course, I developed skills in programming machine learning algorithms and data mining techniques using **R**. 

By the end of the course, I gained a deep understanding of how to use data mining methods to analyze and generate insights from large volumes of data, which I applied through various tasks and projects.
